# Hey, I'm Victor David Medina (I go by David) 👋

**Cloud Operations Engineer** building production‑grade AWS infrastructure with Terraform.

Enterprise‑scale proof: led an Expensify deployment for **1,000+ users**, cutting reconciliation cycle time by **~90%** (1–2 days → 1–2 hours).

---

## 🔧 What I'm Working On

- **Multi‑AZ VPC architectures** with Terraform (public/private subnets, NAT, route tables, least‑privilege security groups)
- **Auto Scaling** with CloudWatch‑driven policies and health checks
- **CI/CD for IaC** using GitHub Actions (fmt → validate → tfsec → plan)
- **Operational documentation**: runbooks, Architecture Decision Records (ADRs), and cost awareness

## 🎯 Start Here (Featured Project)

**👉 [AWS Terraform Portfolio](https://github.com/Victor-David-Medina/aws-terraform-portfolio)**

Production‑style AWS VPC stack built as a Cloud Operations portfolio project:

- Multi‑AZ VPC with public/private subnet segmentation across 2 AZs
- Auto Scaling Group (2–6 instances) with CPU‑based scaling policies
- NAT Gateway for controlled egress from private subnets
- GuardDuty threat detection for continuous security monitoring
- S3 remote state + DynamoDB locking for safe team/CI usage
- GitHub Actions CI (terraform fmt → validate → tfsec → plan)
- Runbook + ADRs + cost table to demonstrate Day‑2 operations thinking
