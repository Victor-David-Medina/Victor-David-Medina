# Hey, I'm Victor David Medina (I go by David) 👋

**Cloud Operations Engineer** building production-grade AWS infrastructure with Terraform.

Enterprise-scale proof: led an Expensify deployment for **1,000+ users**, cutting reconciliation cycle time by **~90%** (1–2 days → 1–2 hours).

## 🔧 What I'm Working On

- **Multi-AZ VPC architectures** with Terraform (public/private subnets, NAT, route tables, least-privilege security groups)
- **Auto Scaling** with target tracking policies and CloudWatch monitoring
- **CI/CD for IaC** using GitHub Actions (fmt → validate → tfsec → plan)
- **Operational documentation**: runbooks, Architecture Decision Records (ADRs), cost governance

## 🎯 Start Here (Featured Project)

**👉 [AWS Terraform Portfolio](https://github.com/Victor-David-Medina/aws-terraform-portfolio)**

Production-style AWS VPC stack built as a Cloud Operations portfolio project:

- Multi-AZ VPC with public/private subnet segmentation across 2 AZs
- Auto Scaling Group (2–6 instances) with CPU-based target tracking
- NAT Gateway for controlled egress from private subnets
- GuardDuty threat detection for continuous security monitoring
- CloudWatch alarms for scaling visibility and cost optimization
- AWS Budget alerts for cost governance
- GitHub Actions CI (terraform fmt → validate → tfsec → plan)
- Runbook + ADRs + cost table to demonstrate Day-2 operations thinking
